## Project Walkthrough

### Step 1: Prior Preparation

Prior to the on-site audit, I organized meetings with relevant personnel, outlined discussion topics, and proactively requested Standard Operating Procedures and the System Security Plan ahead of time to optimize efficiency and respect their schedule.

### Step 2: NIST 800-53 Audit

I audited against NIST 800-53, focusing on Media Protection controls MP-1 through MP-8 in section 3.10.

### Step 3: Control Family Understanding

I read and comprehended the control family (3.10 Media Protection), their discussions, and related controls, and placed them in a spreadsheet.

### Step 8: Repetition for Each Control

I then repeated steps 5-8 for each control from MP-2 through MP-8 by means of interviews, testing, or documentation.
